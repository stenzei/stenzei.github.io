# Basics

## Modeling

Among other fields, in machine learning vectorization is a common approach to 
reduce computation costs. Here I want to show how this approach can be applied
to cellular automata. I am using Conway's Game of Life as an example. 

Cellar automata [see Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) 
are a widely used tool in modeling e.g. when it comes 
to the analysis of spatially explicit dynamics. The classical approach is
to represent the 2-dimensional space as grid and iterate over it to calculate 
neighborhood dynamics grid cell by grid cell. The computational effort for this
is $O(n^3)$ with $n$ representing the width of a square matrix, representing the
landscape. However, when we deal with large landscapes computation costs grow 
strongly.

## Game of Life {#rules}

Conway's Game of Life is a simple but yet interesting cellular automaton (for 
details see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)). 
Implementations for a large number of programming languages can be found 
[here](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The simple set of rules reads as follows:

* A cell can be dead or alive.
* For each cell its eight neighbors are considered.
* A dead cell turns into a living one, if it is surrounded by three
living cells.
* A living cell turns into a dead one, if it is surrounded by less then two 
living cells.
* A living cell turns into a dead one, if it is surrounded by more then three 
living cells.
* In all other situation the cell keeps its status.

# Vectorized version

In the following a vectorized version of the game is shown and explained using 
a 6 x 6 matrix representing the "landscape" where the game takes place.

```{r}
m <- t(matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 
                0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), 6))
```

This is the initial state of of our cellular automaton. To calculate the 
subsequent one, we need to know the number of living neighbors around each cell.
To achieve that, we just transform this matrix $m$ in a few steps. For the
transformation we use another matrix $t$:

```{r}
t <- t(matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
                0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 
                0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 
                0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1), 6))
```

Multiplying matrix $m$ with $t$ yields the number of neighbors in a row.

```{r}
tm <- t %*% m
```

The resulting matrix looks like that:

```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

The numbers of neighbors in a column are calculated by swapping the factors of
that matrix multiplication.

```{r}
tm <- m %*% t
```

Now the resulting matrix reads:

```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

Combining both operations yields the number of neighbors plus the focal cell
itself.

```{r}
tm <- t %*% m %*% t
```
```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

To get only the number of neighboring cells for each cell without the cell 
itself we have to subtract the original matrix $m$.

```{r}
tm <- t %*% m %*% t - m
```
```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

Now, we have the number of neighbors of each cell. Based on this we can 
calculate the next states based on the [rules described above](#rules): 
First, we set all cells to zero that will not be alive in the next time step.

```{r}
tm[tm == 1] = 0
tm[tm > 3] = 0
```
```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

Second, we are interested in all cells with three neighbors and living cells with
two neighbors. By adding the original matrix $m$ to the matrix $tm$, all
living cells with two or tree neighbors get the value 3 or 4. Dead cells with
three neighbors also get the value 3. All other cells get the values 0, 1 or 2.
These will be dead in the next time step.

```{r}
tm <- tm + m
```
```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

Now, all dead cells are set to 0 and all other cells are set to 1.

```{r}
tm[tm < 3] = 0
tm[tm > 0] = 1
```
```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify = "right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

Thus the whole algorithm for one time step reads:

```{r}
tm <- t %*% m %*% t - m
tm[tm == 1] = 0
tm[tm > 3] = 0
tm <- tm + m
tm[tm < 3] = 0
tm[tm > 0] = 1
m <- tm
```

# Modifications

## Von Neumann neighbourhood

If we were only interested in the __Von Neumann neighborhood__ (four neighbors 
are considered), the corresponding calculation of $tm$ in the first line 
would be:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
m <- t(matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 
                0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), 6))
```
```{r}
tm <- t %*% m + m %*% t - 2 * m
```
```{r, comment=NA, echo=FALSE}
write.table(format(tm, justify="right"),
            row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
```

## Torrodial world

If we want to model a torrodial world where the game of life takes place, we 
need to modify the transformation matrix $t$ (add ones in the lower left and 
upper right corners).

```{r}
t <- t(matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 
                1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 
                0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
                0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 
                0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 
                1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1), 6))
```

# R code

The whole algorithm for a 20 x 20 torrodial world reads:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Matrix)

# Constructing the matrix of the game.
width <- 20
# Filling m with 0's.
m <- Matrix(rep(0, width * width), width, sparse = TRUE)

# Constructing a glider in the upper left corner.
i <- 1
j <- 1
# Setting living cells of the glider.
m[i + 1, j] <- 1
m[i + 2, j + 1] <- 1
m[i, j + 2] <- 1
m[i + 1, j + 2] <- 1
m[i + 2, j + 2] <- 1

# Constructing the transformation matrix.
tt <- Diagonal(width)
# Constructing the minor diagonals.
md <- Diagonal(width - 1)
md <- rbind(0, cbind(md, 0))
tt <- tt + md + t(md)
# Making it torrodial. 
tt[c(1,width),c(width,1)] <- 1
  
# Calculating the game for 10 time steps.
for (i in c(1:10)) {
  tm <- tt %*% m %*% tt - m
  tm[tm == 1] = 0
  tm[tm > 3] = 0
  tm <- tm + m
  tm[tm < 3] = 0
  tm[tm > 0] = 1
  m <- tm
}
```

the script for comparing the performance of different implementations in 
parallel on [github](https://github.com/stenzei/GameOfLive).

# Performance

This approach is most advantageous for sparse matrices. To show this, three 
implementations are compared: 

- the straight forward implementations found on [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#R),

- a very fast implementation by petrkeil found on  [r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com/fast-conways-game-of-life-in-r/),

- the implementation described here named *matrices*.

The violin plot below shows performances for a quite sparse matrix. For
less sparse matrices petrkeil performs better than the matrix approach.

The square matrices for the performance test is generated as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Matrix)

m <- Matrix(nrow = side, ncol = side, sparse = TRUE)
m[] <- rbinom(side^2, 1, 0.1)
```

`side` varies from 100 to 1000. For the rosetta implementation only matrices
up to a side length of 300 grid cells are computed.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
tt <- read.csv(file = "../data/perform.csv", na.strings = "-1")
names(tt) <- c("result", "size","rosetta", "petrkeil", "stenze")
ggplot(tt) +
 geom_violin(aes(as.factor(size), rosetta), 
             fill = "#E69F00", scale = "width", color = "darkgray", alpha = 0.5) +
 geom_violin(aes(as.factor(size), petrkeil), 
             fill = "#56B4E9", scale = "width", color = "darkgray", alpha = 0.5) +
 geom_violin(aes(as.factor(size), stenze), 
             fill = "#009E73", scale = "width", color = "darkgray", alpha = 0.5) +
 coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100)) +
 xlab("landscape size") +
 ylab("computation time") +
geom_text(aes(x = 3, y = 60, label = "rosetta"), check_overlap = TRUE, color = "#E69F00") + 
geom_text(aes(x = 7.5, y = 40, label = "petrkeil"), check_overlap = TRUE, color = "#56B4E9") +
geom_text(aes(x = 9, y = 8, label = "matrices"), check_overlap = TRUE, color = "#009E73")
```

# Conclusion

This example can be seen as proof of concept, that for quadratic grids 
using specialized algorithms for sparse matrix computation can be a fast
alternative to classical approaches, which just use three nested for-loops. 
At least for the rule set of Conway's game of life it is possible to use 
linear algebra methods for computing spatio-temporal dynamics. 
In principle this should be possible for other cellular automata as 
well (which has to be proven).

The advantage of this approach is that calculations of system dynamics can be 
done even faster by using optimized algorithms and efficient parallel computing 
strategies like map reduce, which is especially relevant when it comes to very 
large grids.
