How to get ShinyProxy run on Linux systems can be found on the 
[ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io) website. However, on macOS things are 
slightly different. The following holds at least for macOS 10.13.3 on a 2016 
MacBook Pro and bases on the 
[_Getting Started_](https://www.shinyproxy.io/getting-started/) section of the
ShinyProxy website, but is adapted to macOS.

# Prerequisites

## Java 8
You will need the Java 8 runtime environment. First find out your Java version 
(use your terminal):
```{}
java -version
```
You should see something like
```{}
java version "1.8.0_162"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_162-b12)
...
```
If you don't see that, install [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

## Docker 
You will also need Docker. But, this part is fairly different from what 
works on Linux systems.

## Installation
Find out if the Docker daemon is running:
```{}
docker run hello-world
```
You should see something like this:
```{}
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```
If you have Docker installed but not running you can start it from your Terminal 
by
```{}
open /Applications/Docker.app
```
Alternatively, you can start Docker by using the standard way of starting apps
in macOS. If you need to install Docker on your Mac you will find instructions 
how to install it on the [docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
website.

## Docker startup options
When you execute the ShinyProxy JAR file it connects to the Docker daemon on
port 2375. Therefore, you need to configure Docker to allow that. On Linux 
systems, this is done by setting the startup options for the  the Docker daemon.
On macOS for security reasons this port is not exposed directly. A work around
is shown in number 4 of the following attempts to solve the problem. The first
three do not work. So, if you are not interested in what is not working skip 
the next three points.


### 1. Editing `daemon.json`
The following (maybe intuitive) way does __not work__ (at least currently):

- Click ![](../img/docker-whale.png) in your menu bar
- Select _Preferences ..._
- Go to _Deamon_
- Click _Advanced_
- Add to the daemon settings:

```{}
{
  ...
  "hosts" : ["tcp://127.0.0.1:2375", "unix://"],
  ...
}
```

This yields: _"hosts" : Cannot be used in Docker for mac._

### 2. Starting daemon with `-H` option
The following two (__not working__)  approaches can also be found on internet:
```{}
sudo dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375

sudo nohup docker daemon -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock &
```
This works for Linux systems, on macOS both do not work (see 
[here](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/2267) for an explanation).

### 3. Setting `$DOCKER_HOST` variable
Another __not working__ way one could try is to set a system variable. The 
docker client honors $DOCKER_HOST (for details see 
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option)). 
You may proceed as follows:
```{}
DOCKER_HOST=tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
launchctl setenv DOCKER_HOST $DOCKER_HOST
```

### 4. Using a `socat` container
Using a socat container to redirect the Docker API __works__ eventually. See
[here](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/770) for details.
```{}
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 127.0.0.1:2375:2375 bobrik/socat TCP-LISTEN:2375, fork UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker.sock
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:1234
```

# Download
For macOS you need to download the platform-independent JAR file from this 
[site](https://www.shinyproxy.io/downloads/).

# Running ShinyProxy
This part works as described on the ShinyProxy 
[_Getting Started_](https://www.shinyproxy.io/getting-started/#running-shinyproxy) 
website. If you need more details you will find them there.

## Pulling the demo image
```{}
sudo docker pull openanalytics/shinyproxy-demo
```

## Running ShinyProxy
```{}
java -jar shinyproxy-x.y.z.jar
```
Substitute `x.y.z` with the ShinyProxy version number. When running the demo app
you will be asked for username and password. These are "einstein" and "password".

Hope that helps.
