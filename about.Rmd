Hi, I am a System Scientist. Understanding systems through data, 
models and visualization is what I do.

I am using R for most of my data related work. I love to use 
[tidyverse](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse) 
and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com). For dynamic models I prefer C++ with 
[Qt](http://www.qt.io) or Java. 

Occasionally I will post some non-sensitive pieces of my work on this site. 
Hopefully, this might be of some use for somebody.
